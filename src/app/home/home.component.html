          Near-term quantum hardware can support two-qubit operations only on the qubits that can interact with each other. Therefore, to execute an arbitrary quantum circuit on the hardware, compilers have to first perform the task of qubit routing, ie, to transform the quantum circuit either by inserting additional SWAP gates or by reversing existing CNOT gates to satisfy the connectivity constraints of the target topology. The depth of the transformed quantum circuits is minimized by utilizing the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to perform qubit routing by making it both construct each action and search over the space of all actions. It is aided in performing these tasks by a Graph neural network that evaluates the value function and action probabilities for each state. Along with this, we propose a new method of adding mutex-lock like variables in our state representation which helps factor in the parallelization of the scheduled operations, thereby pruning the depth of the output circuit. Overall, our procedure (referred to as QRoute) performs qubit routing in a hardware agnostic manner, and it outperforms other available qubit routing implementations on various circuit benchmarks.

          <mat-card-title>qLEET: visualizing loss landscapes, expressibility, entangling power and training trajectories for parameterized quantum circuits</mat-card-title>

          We present qLEET, an open-source Python package for studying parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which are widely used in various variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. qLEET enables computation of properties such as expressibility and entangling power of a PQC by studying its entanglement spectrum and the distribution of parameterized states produced by it. Furthermore, it allows users to visualize the training trajectories of PQCs along with high-dimensional loss landscapes generated by them for different objective functions. It supports quantum circuits and noise models built using popular quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit, Cirq, and PyQuil. In our work, we demonstrate how qLEET provides opportunities to design and improve hybrid quantum-classical algorithms by utilizing intuitive insights from the ansatz capability and structure of the loss landscape.
