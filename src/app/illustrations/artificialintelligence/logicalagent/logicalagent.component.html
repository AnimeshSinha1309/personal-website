  <h1 class="display-4">Model Filtering</h1>
  <p>
    Classical Artificial Intelligence, from long before the era of Deep Neural Networks, was all about search. Ever since we realized that computers could crunch through massive amounts of data, we thought that we will put together rules that the computer would search through and achieve true intelligence. This would span everything from using simple integration formulae and substitution rules together with some heuristics to make the computers do Calculus. The same with playing games like Pacman, heuristics and some general rules couple with search should help us behave near optimally, as it does. Even today, when we have robots moving around the real world, after the perception is done by a neural network, the planning of where to go and what to do is done through search.

    Model filtering is a form of search, where we maintain a set of possible states we are in, and as we explore the world we keep updating this set of belief states. This is the simplest (computationally inefficient, yet complete) solution we have to solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process">Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP)</a>. These are processes where we are supposed to try to behave optimally in the world, but some part of the state of the world is hidden from us. In the following blog and illustrations, we see an example of how the a simple game can be navigated with Model Filtering. This illustrations is derived from the <a href="https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach by Stuart Russel and Peter Norwig</a>.

    <h1>Wumpus World</h1>
    <p>
      The Wumpus world is a cave with a Monster and Deep Pits. But a huge pile of Gold lights up
      the cave and entices Logical Agents to pursue a journey of great risks to find the Gold.
      Take this journey with me and help me reason out the world, won't you?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reward: Gold</strong> - There is a pile of gold - Game ends with +1000 to score.</li>
      <li><strong>Penalty: Wumpus</strong> - There is one monster - Game ends with -1000 from score.</li>
      <li><strong>Penalty: Pit</strong> - There are many pits in grid - Game ends with -1000 from score.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor: Breeze</strong> - There is a pit in an adjacent tile.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor: Stench</strong> - There is Wumpus in an adjacent tile.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Evolution: All Moves</strong> - Score decreased by 1 point after every move.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Evolution: Up Move</strong> - Score decreased by 10 points after every move.</li>

    <h1>Model Filtering</h1>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;">
      When going through the grid, the agent develops models of the world, of where the dangers might lie
      and tries to find the safe moves by contradicting these models using its knowledge base, which it
      has collected from the measurements it makes. Our visualization for this is the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The agent constructs two models for each possible move, one for Wumpus and one for a Pit
      being in the square it's trying to go to. All models are labelled at the top.</li>
      <li>When checking a model, the agent puts itself in the square it would have been in after the
      move, and assumes that Wumpus/Pit is there. (<strong>The agent is the pink dot</strong>)</li>
      <li>If checking for Wumpus, it labels all squares that would have a stench with
      <strong>red</strong>, and all other squared with <strong>green</strong>, for they would never
      have stench (only one Wumpus)</li>
      <li>If checking for Pits, it labels all the square where a breeze is expected with
      <strong>grey</strong> and lets be all other squares cause they provide no usable information.</li>
      <li>Finally, it validates whether the measurements (shown on the rim,
      <strong>see legend above</strong>) are consistant with what it expected for the model.</li>
      <li>If there is an incosistancy, that square is marked with a <strong>White X</strong>, and
      the model is declared invalid (red-band). Otherwise the models is valid (green-band).</li>
      <li>If either the model with a Pit, or the one with Wumpus cannot be refuted, then the move
      is unsafe to make, more exploration is needed to expand knowledge base.</li>
      <li>The agent should keep executing all the possible moves that are safe and unexplored
      to eventually find the gold!</li>

    <p>A Theorem prover can take up the observations and constraints on the environment, and use And/Or
    statements to prove which of the squares are safe to go to. This will be implemented soon, more
