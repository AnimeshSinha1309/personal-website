    <h2>Wumpus World</h2>
    <p>
      The Wumpus world is a cave with a Monster and Deep Pits. But a huge pile of Gold lights up
      the cave and entices Logical Agents to pursue a journey of great risks to find the Gold.
      Take this journey with me and help me reason out the world, won't you?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reward: Gold</strong> - There is a pile of gold - Game ends with +1000 to score.</li>
      <li><strong>Penalty: Wumpus</strong> - There is one monster - Game ends with -1000 from score.</li>
      <li><strong>Penalty: Pit</strong> - There are many pits in grid - Game ends with -1000 from score.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor: Breeze</strong> - There is a pit in an adjacent tile.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor: Stench</strong> - There is Wumpus in an adjacent tile.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Evolution: All Moves</strong> - Score decreased by 1 point after every move.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Evolution: Up Move</strong> - Score decreased by 10 points after every move.</li>

    <h3>Model Filtering</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;">
      When going through the grid, the agent develops models of the world, of where the dangers might lie
      and tries to find the safe moves by contradicting these models using its knowledge base, which it
      has collected from the measurements it makes. Our visualization for this is the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The agent constructs two models for each possible move, one for Wumpus and one for a Pit
      being in the square it's trying to go to. All models are labelled at the top.</li>
      <li>When checking a model, the agent puts itself in the square it would have been in after the
      move, and assumes that Wumpus/Pit is there. (<strong>The agent is the pink dot</strong>)</li>
      <li>If checking for Wumpus, it labels all squares that would have a stench with
      <strong>red</strong>, and all other squared with <strong>green</strong>, for they would never
      have stench (only one Wumpus)</li>
      <li>If checking for Pits, it labels all the square where a breeze is expected with
      <strong>grey</strong> and lets be all other squares cause they provide no usable information.</li>
      <li>Finally, it validates whether the measurements (shown on the rim,
      <strong>see legend above</strong>) are consistant with what it expected for the model.</li>
      <li>If there is an incosistancy, that square is marked with a <strong>White X</strong>, and
      the model is declared invalid (red-band). Otherwise the models is valid (green-band).</li>
      <li>If either the model with a Pit, or the one with Wumpus cannot be refuted, then the move
      is unsafe to make, more exploration is needed to expand knowledge base.</li>
      <li>The agent should keep executing all the possible moves that are safe and unexplored
      to eventually find the gold!</li>
