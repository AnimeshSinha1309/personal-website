# Fallacious Fallacies!

I long thought that those who give into the fallacies below are making mistakes. They are unable to understand the realities of the world. Maybe I was wrong.

## Sunken Cost

Life was supposed to be Markovian, you don't count the mistakes of your past, you just work on the future. **It is not!!**

Why? Because we don't have an objective function to optimize life on. We sometimes think we do. But maybe more importantly, we want closure. Completeness. Knowing that what we started does end, well or poorly. Knowing what we predicted does play out that way. And we get emotionally attached, hoping against hope, that things will work out in what we had.

Emotional attachments are the best. The drive the best of us, in innovation, in relationships. They're stupid, wrong, force non-markovian decisions on us. But they are the best. And so, sunken cost fallacy isn't a fallacy, it's a consequence of emotion.

## Slippery Slope

Some systems are in stable equilibrium, giving a bit of way doesn't create a run-away situation, things come back to as they were. This happens by the force of environment trying it's hardest at homeostatsis. 

But also, equilibria shift. Not in one blow, not by a cataclysmic run-away where you gave some room and too much got taken from you. But with insidious slowness. Things change, they revert, they change again. And the people, who form the environment of conservativism, do accept the new ways. Both for better and for worse. And this is the source of all problems. We as a society are bad at discerning good from bad. We should allow good change and resist bad, but we can either resist all or allow all.

So it is important to hold your ground on subtle, small things. Don't let go. Fight for what feels right and good, even if the contrary is easy and seems like very little harm. For the slippery slope is real when it comes at scale of a society and timescale of generations.

## Surely, there are others?!

These came to mind. But the worst fallacy is thinking that I have a framework of reasoning (i.e. these fallacies) which allows me to reject ideas without having to actively engage with them. I chose not to think and accept these frameworks. They make me feel smart then, but dumb later.

I make a note to myself - keep thinking, feel dumb today, but smarter tomorrow. `:)`!
