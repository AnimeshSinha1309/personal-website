# Against Growth Mindset!

I know what the growth mindset is, I have it.
I can come each day, find all that's wrong, most pressingly wrong, and improve at it.
I do that, but each day I find that I want more, in each dimension, and I keep falling short.

I can achieve anything. And I keep achieving. But it doens't give me this joy of truly having wanted what I got.

## Growth mindset hides your true wants

Take a step back.
You can grow at anything, but do you want to? Or are you doing it because you can and you have nothing better to do?

If so, don't do it. Small incremental progress is slow failure. That's the worst. It's so much better to fail completely each day but have a hope and a dream, grounded in your experiences, your passions, your love.

## So when is growth mindset okay?

Never! - Nah, I'm not that cynical. But I don't know when.

Maybe, for short bursts of times, when there was a dream, there was a story, truly dear to you, but keeping the string intact needs some small improvements.

Maybe always for short periods, not having this mindset leaves far too many good things that you could have had and you wanted.

**I don't know, but I am trying to fight the urge of using this mindset as cover for my floundering vision.**
